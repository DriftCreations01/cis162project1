    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am Oswaldo Napa and I am a student at Cerritos College currently trying to obtain a degree in computer science. My goal is to eventually find work in the world of game design and stick out to become a professional game developer and create a game that is a staple for gamers in the near future. On my free time I create playable content for Fortnite and have been finding success doing so! Another huge part of my life is collecting action figures and I boast a rather impressive collection that I regualrly take care of and am incredibly proud of. I look forward to the challenges this and many other classes will provide and I am ready to get some work done and step into the world of computer science.</p>

        <li>Going bike riding or swimming with friends is also another activity I find fun!</li>
        <li>I really love to go on late night drives with a group of friends to new places.</li>
